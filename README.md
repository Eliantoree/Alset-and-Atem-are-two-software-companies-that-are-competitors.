[3 points] Alset and Atem are two software companies that are competitors. Alset uses a traditional software development lifecycle, while Atem uses containers. Which one of them would have a faster development and deployment cycle and why?

[3 points] Dr. Doom claims that his company can use VM images instead of Containers to do the same task. Is he correct in claiming so? Explain your answer.

Ans. Dr. Doom’s claim that his company can use VM images instead of containers to perform the same task is technically possible, but it may not be as efficient or suitable for certain scenarios. Here’s an explanation:

Virtual machines (VMs) and containers are both technologies used for isolating applications, but they have different characteristics:

Isolation: VMs provide complete isolation by emulating an entire operating system, including the kernel, while containers share the host OS kernel. This isolation makes VMs more secure but also introduces more overhead.

Resource Overhead: VMs require dedicated system resources, including memory, storage, and CPU, as each VM runs its own guest OS. Containers, on the other hand, can run multiple instances on the same host, sharing resources and resulting in better resource utilization.

FOR THE REST; PURCHASE THE SOLUTION
